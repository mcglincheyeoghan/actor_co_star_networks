# actor_co_star_networks
This was my first assignment for the module Network Analysis. In this assignment, I analysed the relationships between various actors and 
visualised networks of actors who co-starred in movies. The code I used for this assignment can be viewed in the 18300093_Assignment1.ipynb file.
The datasets I used for this assignments are in the 18300093-dataset1.json and 18300093-dataset2.json files. I also produced PNGs of both networks
using Gephi, which can be viewed in the 18300093_network1 and 18300093_network2 PNG files. Both graphs were  produced with Gephi were produced in a 
way such that the colour of the nodes were partitioned based on their modularity class and ranked according to their degree. Both graphs were constructed 
using the force atlas layout and the label sizes were proportional to the size of the node to which they belonged.
